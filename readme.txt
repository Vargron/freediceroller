This is a prototype  for a dice rolling website in angular.
My goal is to have a front end interface  in angular that will:
1. allow a user to roll a dice string
2. return errors when the user rolls a invalid string
3. keeps a history of all rolls with option to reroll
4. clear history route

back end routes will include:
a. user management:
1. register--done
2. login --done
3. edit user(admin only)--done
4. delete user(admin only)--done

b. character management:
1. create character:
character={
    Name:"",
    rolls:[rollstrings],
}
2. add roll to character
3. front end rearange rolls in array
4. save new roll order
5. edit roll in character
6. clone character 

once i have MVP done I will figure out how to add some sort of ads to the site
in order to pay for hosting 

next steps:
1. connect users to characters
2. finish character add route

3. delete routes for characters
4. add roll routes for characters
5. edit roll routes for characters
6. delte roll routes for characters
7. move up/ down/ save routes for rolls within characters. 


next steps night of feb 6th
1. finish character delte route stub
1a. create character edit route/ or change name/desc route that can be done on character page
2. write roll routes on main page
3.
