This is a prototype  for a dice rolling website in angular.
My goal is to have a front end interface  in angular that will:
1. allow a user to roll a dice string
2. return errors when the user rolls a invalid string
3. keeps a history of all rolls with option to reroll
4. clear history route

back end routes will include:
a. user management:
1. register
2. login
3. edit user(admin only)
4. delete user(admin only)

b. character management:
1. create character:
character={
    Name:"",
    rolls:[rollstrings],
}
2. add roll to character
3. front end rearange rolls in array
4. save new roll order
5. edit roll in character
6. clone character 

once i have MVP done I will figure out how to add some sort of ads to the site
in order to pay for hosting
